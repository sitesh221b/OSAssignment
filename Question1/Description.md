So, the above problem states that we have to write a program in C language using fork() system call and child process.
Given example of I/O:
Input: 8
Ouput: 8, 4, 2, 1

According to the question we have to print sequence of numbers depending upon the input.
And also check for valid input and in this case i.e. the entered number should be positive.
If the child process has to execute this then we will use wait() function to make the parent process wait untill the child process is executed
